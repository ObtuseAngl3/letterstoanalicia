letterstoanalicia.com (Fashion Portfolio Website)

A multi-page portfolio for a fashion/design student. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Purpose: publish a polished portfolio for the designer and document my front-end foundations (I primarily work in Python/C++).

## Live Website
https://letterstoanalicia.com

## Features (v1)
- Multi-page structure: Home, Projects, About, Contact
- Responsive layout (Flexbox/Grid)
- Mobile nav toggle (vanilla JS)
- Placeholder images and copy (to be replaced with final assets)
- Accessible semantics (landmarks, headings, alt text)

## Tech Stack
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for layout/typography/responsiveness
- JavaScript (vanilla) for basic interactivity
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Structure
  /docs       # screenshots, planning artifacts
  /images     # placeholders -> real photos later
  index.html
  projects.html
  about.html
  contact.html
  style.css
  script.js
  README.md


## Setup
1. Clone or download.
2. Open "index.html" in a browser.
3. Edit placeholders (images, titles, bios).
4. Commit and push.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Push to "main".
2. Settings -> Pages -> Branch: "main" -> "/root" -> Save.
3. Update the **Live Website** link above.

## Case Study
- **Context:** Build a clean, responsive portfolio for a fashion designer; use it to demonstrate front-end skills.
- **Process:** sitemap -> wireframes -> HTML scaffold -> CSS responsiveness -> minimal JS -> deploy -> iterate.
- **Decisions:** neutral UI to foreground imagery; simple grid for galleries; no frameworks in v1.
- **Result:** shipped v1 quickly with placeholders; plan to replace assets and polish accessibility/performance.
- **Reflection:** first end-to-end web build from scratch; applied problem-solving from Python/C++ to front-end; learned deployment and versioning workflow.

## Roadmap
- **v1.1 (polish):** replace placeholders, improve typography/spacing, add alt text/captions, compress images.
- **v1.2 (UX):** lightbox for gallery, form validation, skip-links and focus states.
- **v2 (optional):** CMS or markdown data, animations, SEO meta, analytics.
